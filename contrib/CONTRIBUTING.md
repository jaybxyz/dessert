# Contributing

If you want to contribute, your help is greatly appreciated. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about this project as well as back end exporting blockchain data. To make the process as smooth as possible please read this document and follow our guidelines. I am happy to review your code but please ensure that you have a clean pull request.

# Pull Request Requirements

Please follow these instructions when submitting a pull request (PR):

* Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub.
* Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
* Add the official repository as a remote called upstream.
* If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
* Create a new branch to work on! Branch from the latest upstream/master.
* Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
* Write or adapt tests as needed.
* Follow the code style of the project, including indentation. Use clang-format if you are unsure.
* Run the tests.
* Modify your commit history so that it tells a story using git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
* Write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code, not what you did to the code.
* Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
* From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's master branch.
* If we request further changes push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
* Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).
